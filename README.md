## Overview
This code uses a neural network to help HR predict whether employees are likely to leave the company. It also predicts the department that best fits each employee, in case employees would be better suited to other departments.	

## Functionality Implemented
* Jupyter Lab, Google Colab
* Installs and library imports: sklearn, numpy, pandas, tensor flow
* Functions: pd.read_csv, nunique, dtypes, train_test_split, value_counts, OneHotEncoder, np.array, reshape, transform, StandardScaler, len, columns, layers.input, layers.Dense, Sequential(), model.add, model.summary, model.compile, model.fit, model.evaluate

## Set Up
* The files wihtin the neural-network-challenge repo were updated using Python version 3.10.14, in Google Colab. To run it, please download the most recent version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), as well as a code editor that runs Python ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=mac), etc.). 
## Run Instructions:
In Terminal (Mac) or GitBash (Windows):
* Ensure that you're running the correct version of Python (see Set Up above)
* Ensure that you're in the directory containing the file before running
* The program will create and analyse the accuracy of each model, and summarize the results. 
## References
* The attrition.ipynb starter file was downloaded from the AI-PT-WEST-MAY-052824_MTTH Module 19 Challenge files and edited to analyze the data.
